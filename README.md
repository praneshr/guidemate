Guide Mate is a Figma plugin which makes adding guides to your frames super easy.

## Features
- Adds side(left, right, top and bottom), vertical and horizontal midpoint guides to a layer or frame with just a click.
- Adds guides to a layer or frame based on margins.
- Automatically adds guides based on your grid requirements.

## Usage
- For side and midpoint guides, use the buttons in the shortcut panels. Each button is enabled with tooltip to explain the purpose of each button.
