Guide Mate is a [Figma](https://figma.com) plugin which makes adding guides to your frames or shapes super easy. It provides shortcuts to add most commonly used guides and a form to add custom guides. It will be an excellent companion when you're working with grid based design systems.

## Features
- Adds side(left, right, top and bottom), vertical and horizontal midpoint guides to a layer or frame with just a click.
- Adds guides to a layer or frame based on margins.
- Automatically adds guides based on your grid requirements.

## Usage
- For side and midpoint guides, use the buttons in the shortcut panels. Each button is enabled with tooltip to explain the purpose of each button.
- Use the form for creating more customized guides. Each input field is self-explanatory. After filling the input just hit the "Add Guides" button.
