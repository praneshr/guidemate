Guide Mate is a [Figma](https://figma.com) plugin which makes adding guides to your frames or shapes super easy. It provides shortcuts to add most commonly used guides and a form to add custom guides. It will be an excellent companion when you're working with grid based design systems.

## Usage
- Select a frame, group or shape.
- Open Guide Mate from the plugins menu.
- Click on one of the icon in the shortcut panel to add left, right, top, bottom or midpoint guides.
- Enter details in the form and click on "Add Guides" to generate custom guides.

## Limitations
- At least one frame or group or shape should be selected before using the plugin.
- Multi selection is not supported. Instead, you can group the items and use the plugin.
- Any selected items should be inside a frame. Page level guides are not supported yet.
